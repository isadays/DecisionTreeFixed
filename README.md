### Why does this error occur?

This error is not a bug in your code—it’s a direct consequence of an internal data‐structure change in scikit-learn’s DecisionTree implementation between versions.

- Structured NumPy array for the tree nodes
Under the hood, a DecisionTreeClassifier stores its split graph in a single NumPy structured array called nodes. Each entry (row) holds all of the per-node metadata (child pointers, feature index, threshold, etc.).

- Internal API change in scikit-learn ≥ 1.3
In scikit-learn 1.3 (and later), the developers added a new field called missing_go_to_left to that nodes array (to support basic missing-value routing) . That means the tree’s dtype went from 7 fields → 8 fields.

- Pickle captures the raw dtype
When you joblib.dump(...) a tree in 1.2 or 1.5.2, it pickles exactly that 7-field dtype. On unpickling in 1.3+, Tree.__setstate__() reads the incoming nodes array and sanity-checks its dtype against the new 8-field expectation—and raises your ValueError when they don’t match.

- Why simple reflection can’t fix it
The Tree class is a Cython extension type with custom __getstate__/__setstate__ that enforces this dtype check in C code—so you can’t just monkey-patch its attributes at Python level without special hacks (like the patch we showed).



### Solution

You can work around this incompatibility entirely inside your notebook by monkey-patching the Tree.__setstate__ method to inject the missing missing_go_to_left field on-the-fly before it does its dtype check. Drop this cell before your joblib. load(...) and you’ll never hit that error.
